* mesa-micro
** Purpose
This is some boiler-plate code to do simple calculations using the
microphysics in MESA.  It is not (yet) particularly general, but has
been useful for me.
** Usage
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
make
./micro
#+END_EXAMPLE
** Example
The example file ignition-CO.f calculates the ignition curve
(eps_nuc_heat = eps_neu_cool) for a 50/50 C/O mixture.
** MESA version
This currently works with r6794.
